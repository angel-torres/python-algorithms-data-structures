# Arrays

Arrays are a data structure that has several unique features. One of the most important ones is that every item within it is indexed and that allows for very quick search if you have the index. You can also add at the end of it in O(1) time complexity. Some of it's cons is that if you want to insert at the beginning then you have to do it at O(n) because you have to shift every value. Also if you don't have the index and are trying to search by something other than the index you'll have to do it at O(n).


**This chart offers a breakdown**

Operation | Time Complexity
|--|--|
Access | O(1)
Search | O(n)
Insertion | O(n)
Deletion | O(n)
